# Super Fast Scan TV
An SSTV Mode that can encode and decode an image in 2 seconds!

Just unzip the two files (encoder) and (decoder), and follow the Usage.txt files to propery use SFSTV!

If you have any issues, feel free to contact me at blenderbach@gmail.com

If you'd like to show me some encodings you've done or received from other users via radio-waves, feel free to send an email as well! 

Enjoy!
:)
